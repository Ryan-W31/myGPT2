## Building a GPT-2 Model from scratch!

This repo is inspired by and follows along Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) youtube playlist.

In this repo, I built a GPT-2 clone based on the [GPT-2 paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) and the official [GPT-2 repository](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2).
